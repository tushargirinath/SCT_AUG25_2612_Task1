# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on key features such as:  
- Square Footage  
- Number of Bedrooms  
- Number of Bathrooms  

The dataset used is the **House Price Dataset**, and the model performance is evaluated using metrics like **R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).**

## ⚙️ Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SCT_AUG25_2612_Task1.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model:

python src/train.py

📊 Results

R² Score: ~0.80 (varies with dataset)

MSE and RMSE reported for evaluation

Visualizations include predicted vs actual prices
🔮 Future Work

Implement Polynomial Regression for non-linear patterns

Compare with advanced models like Random Forest & XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
